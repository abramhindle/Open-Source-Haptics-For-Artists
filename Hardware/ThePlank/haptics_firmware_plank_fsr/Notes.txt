To use The Plank with the Open-Source-Haptics-For-Artists repository, it's necessary to have a way
to disable the force feedback if the user isn't touching the device.  This can be accomplished
by using the FSR as a sensor to check if the user is exerting pressure on it.


• Build the circuit as shown in Figure 5 of the Computer Music Journal article
  "The FireFader: Simple, Open-Source, and Reconfigurable Haptic Force Feedback for Musicians"
  replacing "Motor A."  Instead of connecting the 2nd pin of the potentiometer to Arduino pin A2,
  connect the voltage output of the Hall-effect sensor to Arduino pin A2.
• Repeat the same procedure analogously for a second Plank motor as "Motor B."



USE THE ARDUINO MICRO FOR BUILDING THIS WITH THE MOTOR DRIVER http://www.gravitech.us/2mwfecoadfor.html, ALSO AVAILABLE THROUGH MOUSER.



// Anyone trying to use The Plank with Open-Source-Haptics-For-Artists should first try the 
// Synth-A-Modeler models, which are compatible with this firmware.  To do this, run 
// 'make jackqt' inside the SaM subdirectory of the part of the repo
// https://github.com/eberdahl/Open-Source-Haptics-For-Artists/tree/master/Software/Synth-A-Modeler
// and visit https://ccrma.stanford.edu/wiki/SynthAModelerFireFaderLab for additional instructions
// to set that up.
// 
// After getting those working, then try the models in Max using the FireFader~ object to interface
// with the firmware--see
// https://github.com/eberdahl/Open-Source-Haptics-For-Artists/blob/master/Software/Max/Readme.txt
